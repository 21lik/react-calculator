A big thank you to W3Schools, Youtube, and https://blog.logrocket.com/using-react-django-create-app-tutorial/ for helping me learn Django and integrating it with React.

React webpage: http://localhost:3000/
* In a cmd or Git Bash terminal, navigate to `calculator/frontend`, then enter `npm start`

Django backend: http://localhost:8000/
* In a cmd or Git Bash terminal, navigate to `calculator`, then enter `py manage.py runserver` in a cmd or Git Bash terminal

The React calculator can function without the Django backend, but utilizing memory and history require the Django backend to be running simultaneously. Apologies for any bugs that persist in the program.
